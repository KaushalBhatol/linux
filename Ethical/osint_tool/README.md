# OSIANT TOOLS

## __âš  Warning__

These tools are only for learning _ethical hacking_, don't use them __against the law__. It was so risky for you.

__I'm not responsible for anything__. Use for personal learning only. All the tools are available on _public sites_.

## Primary Requirements

You can use any Debian-based distro for using these tools. In my case, I'm using [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).

Most of tools are python based, so installing python3 was great idea for you.

installation:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install -y python3 pip
